## Common Errors

#### StoryBoard Connections: 

A common error occurs when you attempt to connect an object from the story board to your file multiple times. Usually to fix a mistake, such as, labelling a button as an Outlet instead of an Action. 
 
 The debug area displays this: 
**...this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key '.....'**

This is easily fixed! 

Go to the Connections Inspection on your storyboard and delete the connection you no longer want. It is usually marked with a yellow triagle ! sign.
