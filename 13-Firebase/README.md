## Firebase

Firebase is collection of tools that make doing a lot of what might be complex things very straight forward. 

It is developed and maintained by Google. The iOS documentation can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0). Use it!

### Important

We will primarily be introducing you to **"Cloud Firestore"**. This is the newer database component of Firebase which replaces the **"Realtime Database"** component. Don't get confused between the two. When we talk about the "database" we're talking about Firestore.
