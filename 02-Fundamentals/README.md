## 02 - Fundamentals 

### Notes

Here you will find support material from the workshop we did that covers: 
+ Classes
+ Properties
+ Functions

### Tips
+ Remember to check your brackets - they should all have a pair. Remember you can double click on any bracket to check where its pair is, this should be made clear by a block of code being highlighted. 
+ Check your spacing, the indentations on the project attached show how it should be. If you get into a good habit of spacing your project correctly it will make it a lot easier to read!  
+ Check for typos and capital letters - it all needs to match.
+ A few of you asked where you can read up on this - I would recommend the swift documentation: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html
its very simply put with lots of examples. 


### Extension
There is also another file in the Xcode Playground called Extension. It includes a second class and adds a bit more detail to functions as well as introducing you to 'for loops'. I have included a bit about for loops in the Functions-Methods file, have a read through and give it a go. 

There is also similar documentation for all this in the General Syntax folder.
