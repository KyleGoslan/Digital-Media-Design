 ## Classes

A class provides a template/blueprint/design layout for your object. 

We write a class by using the keyword ‘class’ followed by the name of the class. Remember to use an uppercase when naming your class. 

The space between the curly brackets is where the properties and functions to do with that class are kept. (If it goes outside the brakcets xcode won't know what the added detail is referring to.)  


```swift
class Person {


}
```

^ This is a blank class. 

Properties and Methods add detail and functionality to your class.
