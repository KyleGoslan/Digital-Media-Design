In your first workshop you will make a simple number guessing game with just a slider.

This is a stripped down example of a tutorial that can be found online here: [Link](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5993-your-first-ios-and-uikit-app). This is an excellent website for tutorial. we strongly suggest you spend some time looking at the resources on this site and working through some of the tutorials. There are also several excellent courses on LinkedIn Learning: [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/swift-5-essential-training/)

**Note:** Even though you are making a "game". Start your project from a **Single View Application**.
