 ## Loops

A loop allows you to control the flow of your project. It goes over a list or array of items. The items in the array can be: numbers (Int), dictionaries or characters in a String.

For example: 
+ Initialize the Array
```swift
var names = ["Grace", "Kyle", "Amy", "John"]
```

+ Iterate through the array
```for name in names {
print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
```
