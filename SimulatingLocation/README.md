## Simulating Location

This is an example GPX file used to simulate a custom user movement. You will need to use these when testing on a simulator. 

This example has a user move between three points around bournemouth. You can change coordinates and add/remove as many points as necessary for your testing. 

```xml 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<gpx version="1.1" creator="Xcode">
    

    <wpt lat="50.742593" lon="-1.892996">
        <time>2014-09-24T14:55:37Z</time>
    </wpt>
    
    <wpt lat="50.722438" lon="-1.885142">
        <time>2014-09-24 T14:55:45Z</time>
    </wpt>
    
    <wpt lat="50.715618" lon="-1.875401">
