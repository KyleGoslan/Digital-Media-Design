## Workshop 05 - View Controllers

**Generally describe what a View Controller is.**

**All your view controllers are "sub classes" of what?**

**What is the life cycle of the view controller?**

**Name at least two (other than the one given) of the functions we can use in this life cycle.**
  
```swift
  viewDidLoad()
```
 
**What is a segue?**

**What is the segue "Identifier"?**

**How do you setup a segue from a button in your storyboard?**

**How do you setup a segue between view controllers (ie without using a button)?**

**How do you call a segue programatically?**

**Briefly describe how you pass data between two view controllers (you may want to save some snippets of code here)?**
