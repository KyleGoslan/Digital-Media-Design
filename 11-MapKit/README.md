## 11 - Mapkit

### Notes

Here you will find support material from the workshop we did that covers: 
+ MapKit

### Tips
+ Add constraints to all the objects you put in your view controller. 
+ Check MapKit and CoreLocation are imported
+ Remember to check your brackets - they should all have a pair. Remember you can use the double click on any bracket to check where its pair is.
+ Check your spacing, the indentations on the project attached show how it should be. If you get into a good habit of spacing your project correctly it will make it a lot easier to read!  
+ Check for typos and capital letters - remember it all needs to match.
