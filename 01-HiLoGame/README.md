## 01 - Hi-Lo Game

In your first workshop you will make a simple number guessing game just using some simple UI components from UIKit.

**Note:** Even though you are making a "game". Start your project from a **Single View Application**. 

You can download the finished example of the project we created together here: [Link](https://github.com/KyleGoslan/Digital-Media-Design/blob/master/CompletedDemos/01%20-%20Hi-Lo-Game.zip)
