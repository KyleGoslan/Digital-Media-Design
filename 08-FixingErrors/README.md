## 08 - Fixing Errors

### Brackets 
Closing classes, functions
Remember you can double click on a bracket to find its pair 
Brackets ALWAYS come in pairs!

### Connections Inspector
Are your UIElements connected to your code in the right way (action/outlet)

### Control Flow
Have you declared the variable you want to use in a func or a loop

### Libraries
Have you included (imported) all the libraries you intend on using (hint: using location you'll need a MapKit)


There is a broken project in the [Completed Demos](https://github.com/KyleGoslan/Digital-Media-Design/blob/master/02-Fundamentals/Functions.md) try and find all the errors. 

REMEMBER - even though you might be seeing 50+ errors DONT PANIC! The majority of these will be solved with really quick fixes such as a class not being closed with a bracket.
